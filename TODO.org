#+TITLE: TODO LIST

- Implement most of the possible useful [[http://eclipse.org/jgit/][JGit]] commands as Ant tasks.
- Error handling and inheritance hierarchy.
- The Ant task doesn't seem that much friendly at this time even though it's usable.
- Move antunit tests out of the git tree, few things got pushed automatically with a dummy user.
