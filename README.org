#+TITLE: Ant tasks for Git

* Summary
This is a set of basic Apache Ant Git tasks to automate the GitHub/Maven release process.

Apache Ant Git tasks will be reused in all rimerosolutions' projects using Apache Ant as build tool.

The big picture is that at some point, some kind of Ant-Git-Release workflow API will be introduced:

- Add ant-git-release-conventions-api as dependency to your Ant Ivy build
- Add a corporate implementation of ant-git-release-conventions-api or use the rimero-git-release-contentions-api implementation (Java SPI to keep things simple)
